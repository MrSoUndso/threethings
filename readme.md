# Daily Todos to make better Humans


### Phases
The phases and goals of this project is multifaceted.

Phase 1:
First goal is to make a really nice PWA todo list for three things you want to improve upon.
These betterment todos can be either selected to be weekly or monthly, locking in user focus for that period of time.
I want the app to randomize the order it shows the items each day, so that one day might be "study, exercise, read" 
the next day would be "exercise, study, read", etc.

Phase 2:
Bring the app into a bigger context, allowing users to see what other people are focusing on by creating a sharing aspect of the app.
Allow for voting systems to be implemented.

Phase 3:
???

### Stack
Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS for the time being. I'd like to use serviceworkers and localstorage to cache the entire app so it can be self
contained and then deploy it to the app store by the end of October (for phase 1 at least).


### Design
Here's what I'm envisioning Phase 1 to look something like:

Comments and ideas for how it'd look / function would be greatly appreciated.


### How to contribute
Self assign yourself to an issue you can handle, then make a PR when it's complete. Feel free to create issues for cool features that you'd like to see added on!




## This is an open source project meant to better peoples lives. I hope we can build this cool thing together!
