# Daily Todos to make better Humans

The phases and goals of this project is multifaceted.

Phase 1:
First goal is to make a really nice PWA todo list for three things you want to improve upon.
These betterment todos can be either selected to be weekly or monthly, locking in user focus for that period of time.
I want the app to randomize the order it shows the items each day, so that one day might be "study, exercise, read" 
the next day would be "exercise, study, read", etc.

Phase 2:
Bring the app into a bigger context, allowing users to see what other people are focusing on by creating a sharing aspect of the app.
Allow for voting systems to be implemented.

Phase 3:
???

This is an open source project meant to better peoples lives. I hope we can build this cool thing together!

Here's what I'm envisioning Phase 1 to look something like:

Comments and ideas for how it'd look / function would be greatly appreciated.
